            <p><strong>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,</strong> including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and accuracy, reliability, or completeness.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification. You agree to cooperate with our defense of such claims, and you may not settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">13. Changes to Terms</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will post updated Terms with a new "Effective date", notify users of material changes (via email or in-app notification), and provide reasonable notice of changes.</p>

            <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Notice, constitute the entire agreement between you and PocketPal regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full effect. Our failure to enforce any provision does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.</p>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our consent. We may assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. These Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship between you and PocketPal.</p>
